## John the Ripper

1. Using an effective wordlist, like rockyou.txt, is useful.
2. By default, rockyou.txt is located at /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
3. You may have to unzip rockyou.txt.gz. To do so, enter the following input: 
	`sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`
4. Example of proper John the Ripper input:
	`john <password file> --format=RAW-MD5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
